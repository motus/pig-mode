h2. Pig mode for Emacs

pig-mode is an Emacs major mode for editing "Pig":http://hadoop.apache.org/pig scripts. Currently it supports syntax highlighting and indentation for Pig versions 0.2 to 0.11. We track the changes to Pig syntax and try to support new Pig features ASAP.

PS. This project was originally hosted on sourceforge.net; we still maintain the page there, but from now on all new changes will be pushed to github first.
